# Kristers Quiz

## Description
The Quiz showcases some of my newly learned skills in Javascript. I have learned an introduction in how you can navigate and interact with Javascript trough funtions, event listeners, query selectors and a little of local storage. 
While This page is not the most efficient, I believe that found a good solution to get where I wanted to be...almost. This challenge contains a large amount of material that I have not been introduced to which caused troubles throughout. The errors that I would like to have corrected are to have the users input and score stored together in local storage and then output to the highscore page.
